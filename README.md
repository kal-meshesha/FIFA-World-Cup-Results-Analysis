### Executive Summary

Football analysts and fans often struggle to extract meaningful insights from historical World Cup data due to its size and complexity.

Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard analyzing historical FIFA World Cup match results, team performance, scoring trends, and tournament outcomes.

The analysis highlights dominant teams, goal-scoring trends, and performance patterns across tournaments — transforming raw match data into clear, visual insights.

### Business Problem

The FIFA World Cup spans decades of matches, teams, and outcomes. However, raw match-level data does not clearly answer key questions such as:

Which countries perform best historically?

How have goal-scoring trends changed over time?

Which teams consistently reach later tournament stages?

Are there patterns in host country performance?

This project converts historical match data into structured, visual analysis.

### Methodology
#### 1. Data Preparation

Cleaned World Cup results dataset

Verified match scores and team names

Structured tournament year and match stage fields

Used data dictionary to understand variable definitions

#### 2. Data Modeling & Visualization (Tableau)

Built interactive dashboards

Created filters by:

Year

Country

Stage

Designed visualizations including:

Total wins by country

Goals scored by tournament

Match outcome comparisons

Historical performance trends

### Skills Used

Tableau

Data Cleaning

Data Visualization

Trend Analysis

Aggregation & Grouping

Dashboard Design

Storytelling with Data

### Key Insights

Certain countries consistently dominate World Cup history.

Goal scoring patterns vary by tournament year.

Some teams show strong consistency in advancing to later stages.

Host country advantage appears in several tournaments.

### Business / Analytical Insights

Historical performance can inform predictive sports analysis.

Tournament trends help evaluate competitive balance.

Interactive dashboards improve accessibility of large historical datasets.

### Next Steps

If given more time, I would:

Add predictive modeling for match outcomes

Incorporate player-level statistics

Analyze goal distribution by stage (group vs knockout)

Compare host performance vs non-host performance statistically

Develop advanced metrics such as win percentage and goal differential
